1-page Report for Prog Assignment 1

The goal of this program is to read from a local text file 
and report how many lines, words, characters. For a 10-k specifically, 
it needs to report the number of parts. It must both print to the terminal
and to an output file.

First, I saved the report to as a text file and put it in my "data" folder.
Then, in my source folder I created the "FileReader" module for reading 
a file and printing the stats. I first initialize the variables for lines, 
chars, words, and parts and set them all to 0. Then I wrote the readFile() 
method which takes in a file name. It iterates through each line in the file
and and for each line it increases the number of lines by 1, counts the number
of words and adds that value to the word count, and counts the number of 
characters using the length of each line. Additionally, it searches for parts
by searching for the word "PART" in all caps and adding the lines to a list. 
After all lines are searched, the number of parts is found by removing 
duplicates and and taking the length of that list. 

Next, I wrote the printStats() method for printing to the output file and to
the terminal. It prints the variables to the terminal and then opens the 
stats.txt file with the correct company name, writes to the file, then closes the file.

In the test folder, I created a program to test the file reader. It prompts
the user for which company's report they want stats on, then uses the 
readFile() and printStats(). If the input is invalid, it will inform the user. 
After these are run, the program terminates.
