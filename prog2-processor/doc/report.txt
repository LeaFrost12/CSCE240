The goal of this program is to be able to answer certain questions about both businesses 
(Apple and Amazon) based on information from their 10-k forms. Each question must be mapped
to a specific item/section from the form and the contents of that section is returned when
a question is asked. The results of the question are written to an output file and to the 
command line.
