Instructions for running: From the "src" directory, run the command "python userintent2querymapper.py". 
Ask a question related to the questions from "test_output.txt".

The goal of this program is to be able to answer certain questions about both businesses 
(Apple and Amazon) based on information from their 10-k forms. Each question must be mapped
to a specific item/section from the form and the contents of that section is returned when
a question is asked. The results of the question are written to an output file and to the 
command line. 

I created a word matcher module that contains the methods that I implement in my userintent2querymapper
module. The word matcher module contains the methods matchSentence(), matchWord(), editDistance(), and
isMatch().

The matchSentence() method iterates through the user input and finds matches of the mapped words.
It continues to run until a single match is found or the end of the string is reached.
The match percentage is calculated by dividing the number of matches by the number of words
in the mapped sentence. 

The matchWord() method calculated the edit distance between a user word and a mapped word, then 
calculated the match percentage from the ratio of distance and mapped word length.

The editDistance() method is a recursive function that counts the number of intertions, removals,
and replacements needed to convert from one word to the other. If two words are exactly equal, they
will have an edit distance of 0.

The isMatch() function determines if two strings are a match if the match percentage is greater 
than the threshold.

In the userintent2querymapper module, I use the isMatch(method) to determine which supported intent
matches the user utterance. If none match, the user is asked to try again. Like in the past PA's,
the output is written in an output file.
